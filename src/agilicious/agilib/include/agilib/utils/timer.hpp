/*
 * Timer class to perform runtime analytics.
 *
 * This timer class provides a simple solution to time code.
 * Simply construct a timer and call it's `tic()` and `toc()` functions to time
 * code. It is intended to be used to time multiple calls of a function and not
 * only reports the `last()` timing, but also statistics such as the `mean()`,
 * `min()`, `max()` time, the `count()` of calls to the timer , and even
 * standard deviation `std()`.
 *
 * The constructor can take a name for the timer (like "update") and a name for
 * the module (like "Filter").
 * After construction it can be `reset()` if needed.
 *
 * A simple way to get the timing and stats is `std::cout << timer;` which can
 * output to arbitrary streams, overloading the stream operator,
 * or `print()` which always prints to console.
 *
